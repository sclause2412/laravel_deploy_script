# Laravel automatic installation and deploy

This tool tries to install an automatic deployment solution for your GitHub repository with a Laravel app.

It is always annoying to me if I have a Laravel project which I want to deploy to a server which does not natively support automatic Laravel deployment. In my case I was using an own VPS with Cloudpanel installed. Everytime when I install or update a Laravel application I have either to generate all files on a local computer and then update the server with FTP, or I have to login to the server with SSH and do it there manually. Therefore, I created this little tool to do this for me automatically.

Currently this tool supports installation only for things I need, so maybe some features are currently missing (but they may come in future).

## Usage

- Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/sclause2412/laravel_deploy_script/releases) page.
- Create a new website on your webserver using the public folder as root for your website (this is the default folder for Laravel).
- Upload the [install.php](install.php) file to the public folder.
- Run the installation on any browser (e.g. https://example.com/install.php)

The script will guide you through the installation.

### Requirements

To use the automatic installation and deployment your server must have installed:

- PHP
- npm (Node)
- Composer
- GIT
- SSH client (if using a private repository)
